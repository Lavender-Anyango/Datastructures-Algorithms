# Heaps in Python

This project demonstrates the use of heaps in Python using the `heapq` module. Heaps are a type of binary tree where the parent node is always smaller (or larger, depending on the type of heap) than its child nodes. They are particularly useful for implementing priority queues and other data structures that require efficient access to the smallest (or largest) element.

## Features

- **Heapify**: Convert a list into a heap.
- **Heappush**: Add a new element to the heap.
- **Heappop**: Remove and return the smallest element from the heap.
- **Heapreplace**: Replace the smallest element with a new value and return the old smallest element.
- **nsmallest and nlargest**: Retrieve the n smallest or n largest elements from the heap.
